" When you type an open brace, this will automatically insert a closing brace
" on the same line, after the cursor. If you quickly hit Enter after the open
" brace, (to begin a code block), the closing brace will be inserted on the
" line below the cursor. If you quickly press the open brace key again after
" the open brace, Vim won't insert anything extra, you'll just get a single
" open brace. Finally, if you quickly type an open and close brace, Vim will
" not do anything special.
